This directory contains the statistics scripts for "There Goes the
Neighborhood".

* mlm.sas: tests the three main hypotheses of the paper

* liwcProcessing.r: R script that does all of the analysis necessary
  for the data from LIWC.  Most of this data really isn't that
  interesting, but whatever.
