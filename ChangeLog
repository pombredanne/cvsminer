	* src/personobjects.py: created a related join to profile

	* src/dbobjects.py: commented out all the old cruft related to bug settings
	* src/personobjects.py (Person): added link to bugzillaProfiles
	* sql/bugzilla_additional.sql: fixed typo in bz_profiles_person

	* sql/bugzilla_additional.sql: new file to link up bugzilla users
	to persons in our database
	* src/bugTransfer.py: moved to src/bugs/bugTransfer.py to keep the
	source code directory relatively clean.

2005-11-30  Patrick Wagstrom  <pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu>
	* src/bugTransfer.py: lots of changes to allow for good loading
	of data from MySQL databases

	* src/bugzilla.sql (bz_keywords): fixed bz_keywords_bug_id_idx
	to be on bz_keywords(bug_id, keywordid)
	(bz_longdescs): removed not null constraint from bug_when.  This
	should be eligable for not null according to dump from MySQL,
	but apparently some elements still contain null values

	* src/bugTransfer.py (dump): fix start at point
	* src/bugzilla.sql: remove misplaced unique constraint on
	bz_cc_who_idx

	* src/bugTransfer.py: new program to assist with migrating data
	over from bugzilla
	* sql/bugzilla.sql: fixed creation_ts and severity columns

2005-11-29  Patrick Wagstrom  <pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu>
	* sql/bugzilla.sql: new file for importing of bugzilla data

	* src/conference/conferenceLoader.py (loadConferenceFile): fix
	issue with not stripping conference and presentation names
	properly

2005-11-29  Larry Maccherone  <larrym@andrew.cmu.edu>
	* src/findPersons.py: Handle names like "o'leary" properly in
	strip punctuation.  I removed the regex to do this.  It might 
	be a bit slower but it should be easier to modify and the speed
	should not be significant for this call.

2005-11-29  Patrick Wagstrom  <pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu>
	* src/findPersons.py (PUNCTUATION_RE): it's amazing how missing a
	little carat can screw up a regex so badly

	* src/findPersons.py (connectPersonsToUsers): fix for odd case where
	no possible names are created for an alias -- strange?

	* src/findPersons.py (connectPersonsToUsers): fixed error in the
	debugging output

	* src/findPersons.py (mineMailMessage): use %s to force string
	representation in debugging rather than + operator which
	can cause program to fail.
	(stripPunctuation): use regular expression
	to strip punctuation out of strings.
	(connectPersonsToUsers): optimization improvements, new logging
	* src/personobjects.py (RecordSource): define _set_toolTimestamp
	to be null.  It appears that Larry was trying to have it get the
	date of the file it is executing it, however this does not seem to
	work at all on Conway.  It continually complains that it can't
	find the file even if it is in the same directory.

2005-11-28  Larry Maccherone  <larrym@andrew.cmu.edu>
	* src/findPersons.py: Added more reporting to help figure out
	problems reported by Patrick.  Totally changed the way user and
	person connections are made so that it will not make connections
	unless there is only one viable candidate.  I still need to add
	the UI elements to confirm these.  I also added statistics to
	tell us what percentage of user names are connected to persons. 

2005-11-28  Patrick Wagstrom  <pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu>
	* src/findPersons.py (buildTryNames): fix ticket #12

	* src/conference/conferenceLoader.py (loadConferenceFile): now
	properly handles conference attendees with email addresses too

	field

	(loadConferenceFile): fixed end of file issue where sometimes the
	last record would be ignored if the file did not end with a blank
	line
	* src/dbobjects.py (Presentation): allow null for startDate and
	stopDate

	* src/conference/conferenceLoader.py (loadConferenceFile): now
	properly sets if someone was a presenter or attendee.  
	(loadUser) enahancments to interactive mode
	* sql/person.sql (person): small changes to make it create person
	table

	* src/conference/conferenceLoader.py (loadUser): updated for
	reverted changes in structure of person and alias

	* sql/person.sql: made person.primary_alias not null and
	alias.person_id nullable
	* src/personobjects.py: changed to reflect modifications of
	person.sql

	* sql/cvsminer.sql: inserted code to make script exit unless you're
	really sure you want to run it

	* src/conference/confereceLoader.py renamed to
	src/conference/conferenceLoader.py -- my bad

	* src/conference/confereceLoader.py (loadConferenceFile): made
	it actually bomb out on errors in dry run

	* src/conference/confereceLoader.py (loadConferenceFile): added
	ability to perform a dry run execution where the input file is
	merely validated against existing system information.

2005-11-26  Patrick Wagstrom  <pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu>
	* src/personobjects.py (Person): set default of primaryAlias to null

	instead of RealPerson

2005-11-26  Larry Maccherone  <larrym@andrew.cmu.edu>
	* sql/runOnce11-25.sql: creates alias table, copies names to alias 
	table, drops name field from person table

	* src/peronobjects.py: update to include changes to database including
	magic field for name so existing code that relied upon it will not
	be broken.  Note that code that directly talked to the name field
	in the person table will be broken

	* src/findPersons.py: first commit of unattended person finder.
	Mines EmailAddress table for aliases and emailAddresses.
	Mines User table for Person-User connections.  Note that these
	are not validated.  However, in a sampling of about 20, 80% were
	correct.  That means that 4 out of 20 were wrong.  Also, that
	stat is for ones where it makes a match.  There are many for which
	it does not make a match.

	* sql/person.sql: updated to match new structure

2005-11-23  Larry Maccherone  <larrym@andrew.cmu.edu>
	* src/personobjects.py: changed the way that the currently running 
	tool is captured for RecordSource

	version is at source:/trunk/src/datasetMaker.py#17

2005-11-11  Larry Maccherone <larrym@andrew.cmu.edu>
      
	* src/personobjects.py: first commit - used InheritableSQLObject
	to automatically capture the source of any connection but
	you can use the main classes (Person, PersonUser, and EmailAddress)
	as you would any other SQLObject class.  The RecordSource magic
	will occur behind the scenes except when you want to annotate
	the record with a second source or notes.

	* sql/person: first commit

2005-11-10  Patrick Wagstrom  <pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* src/mail/fastloader.py: new file for rapid loading of multiple
	mailing lists at one time.

	* src/mail/mailscraper.py: cleaned up code so it functions only as
	a mail scraping program, not as a parsing program anymore.
	Simplified the command line arguments drastically.
	
	* src/mail/loadMailLists.py: file moved
	* src/mail/mailscraper.py: file added.  Original code was in
	mailscraper project.  This file is used to scrape mail archives
	down.  Then use mailloader.py to load them. 

	* src/projectJoiner.py: now ensures that any master projects
	selected are indeed part of the community.  However, it still lets
	projects be a part of any community.  I'm not sure if that is a
	bug or a feature.

2005-11-08  Patrick Wagstrom  <pwagstro@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* src/projectJoiner.py: new file to join multiple projects
	together as one project.

	(Project): updated to point to a masterProject

	* sql/cvsminer.sql: created community and master_project tables.
	Modified project table to point to master_project with a foreign
	key which is not null.  This will default to an unknown project
	for data currently in the database.  Please note: this means we'll
	need to do some other work regarding CVSloader and that it is
	probably going to be broken for a while.

	created some more sequences indexes related to all this too.

	* sql/cvsminer.sql (project, virtual_project): undid changes for
	virtual project stuff

	* src/dbobjects.py (MailRecipient, MailMessage): added toName and
